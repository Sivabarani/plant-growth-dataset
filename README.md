# Plant-growth-dataset
This dataset contains details about plants.

In this dataset, we can predict the growth milestone of plant based on various feature like environment and plant management. 

**Understanding Supervised Learning** Supervised learning involves predicting an outcome based on labeled data. 
Initially, I considered this dataset for supervised learning (Classification) applications, particularly for analyzing growth of plants.

**Dataset Description**
1. Soil_Type - It refers to the type of soil. 
2. Sunlight_Hours - It tracks the total amount of sunlight exposure the plant receives over a given period.
3. Water_Frequency -  How often the plants are watered, indicating the watering schedule
4. Fertilizer_Type - The type of fertilizer used for nourishing the plants
5. Temperature - The ambient temperature conditions under which the plants are grown.
6. Humidity: The level of moisture or humidity in the environment surrounding the plants.
7. Growth_Milestone: Descriptions or markers indicating stages or significant events in the growth process of the plants.
   (0 - it does not acheive the milestone, 1 - it achecives the milestone)
   
**Objective** The goal of this analysis is to determine whether the plant achieves the milestone or not. While the "Growth_Milestone" column is our main focus, we may also explore how other features relate to it, noting that they can be considered independent variables in this context.

**Understanding Data Relationships** **Dependent vs. Independent Variables:** Dependent Variable: In this case, the "Growth_Milestone" column,
which we aim to analyze or predict. Independent Variables: Other features such as soil_Type, Sunlight_Hours, Water_Frequency, Fertilizer_Type, Temperature, Humidity, Growth_Milestone
